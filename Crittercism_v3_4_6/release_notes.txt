Crittercism iOS Client Library Release Notes
================================================================================

Version 3.4.6 (November 29, 2012)

- Added async mode for breadcrumb writing
- Removed delegate method that no longer applies since support forums were
removed in v 3.4
- Dropped docs from the package. The online documentation is the canonical
reference.

Version 3.4.5 (November 6, 2012)

- Internal cleanup.

Version 3.4.0 (October 18, 2012)

- Support forums have been dropped from the library.
- init* "initializer" methods have been deprecated in favor of enable* methods.

For example, you should call:

[Crittercism enableWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]

instead of

[Crittercism initWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]

This change was made to reflect the fact that the init* methods were not
actually init methods in the way most Objective-C developers would think of
them. Calling the old methods will continue to work, but will issue warnings
during your build.

- Reduce the number of headers we distribute. Crittercism.h is all you need.
- Eliminate potential conflict with JSONKit headers for users of that library.
- Improved support for delayed initialization of Crittercism.
